# SimReassort
Code from Lundgren et al "The number and pattern of viral genomic reassortments are not necessarily identifiable from segment trees". DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.20.558687](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.20.558687).

**SimReassort** is a minimal package modified from [**phylopomp**](https://github.com/kingaa/phylopomp), which simulates and infers from genealogies given a broad classes of compartmental epidemiological models, described in King et al (2022), doi: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2021.11.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2021.11.003).

**SimReassort** simulates transmission dynamics and the genealogical evolutions for two-segment viruses, using a linear-birth-death model structure.
